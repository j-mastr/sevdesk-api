# Unofficial SevDesk API Documentation

Welcome to the unofficial sevdesk API Documentation! This project aims to provide a stable yet up-to-date and comprehensible OpenAPI specification based on the [official OpenAPI specs](https://api.sevdesk.de/). Here, you'll find all the necessary information to interact with the sevdesk API efficiently.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to maintain an accurate and reliable OpenAPI specification for the sevdesk API. The official API documentation is sometimes inaccurate, frequently updated and the updates are poorly communicated, making it difficult to use as an accurate and complete reference. This project will document discrepancies between the official specification and the actual API while tracking changes in the official specification.

## Project Structure

- **`external/openapi.yaml`**: This file contains [the official OpenAPI specification](https://api.sevdesk.de/openapi.yaml) as provided by sevdesk. It is frequently updated during release to reflect the most recent API changes and stays stable in between.
- **`openapi.yaml`**: This is the stable OpenAPI specification. It is adapted with community-provided changes to address any known deviations from the actual specs. This file is periodically updated during releases to ensure compatibility and accuracy.

## SDK Generation

One of the primary use cases for this repository is generating SDKs (Software Development Kits) for various programming languages. By using the provided `openapi.yaml` specifications, developers can easily generate SDKs tailored to their preferred programming language e.g. using the [OpenAPI generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).
